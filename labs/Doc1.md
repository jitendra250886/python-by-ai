## âœ… Steps (What I did)
1. Created GitHub repository named **`Python-by-AI`**.
2. Added **`.gitignore`** and **`README.md`** using the GitHub UI.
3. Installed **Visual Studio** (Windows).
4. Cloned the repository to local machine and opened the folder in Visual Studio.
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Python-by-AI.git
    cd Python-by-AI
    # optional: ensure primary branch name is main
    git branch -M main
    Verified `.gitignore` and `README.md` exist in the project.



echo "# Labs" > labs/README.md   # placeholder index for labs
```

## ðŸ§¾ Code (core snippet)
> (Optional quick sanity check â€” run a simple script later when Python is set up.)
```python
print("Hello, Python-by-AI!")
```

## ðŸŸ¢ Output / Result
```
Hello, Python-by-AI!
```

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Basic repo setup on GitHub and local clone workflow.
- Where `.gitignore` and `README.md` live in the project.
- Keeping notes in Markdown under `labs/` helps track progress.

## ðŸ§© Issues & Fixes
- None today.

## ðŸ“Œ Commit
```bash
git add labs/2025-10-29-initial-setup.md labs/README.md
git commit -m "docs: add first lab entry (initial setup)"
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Set up a Python virtual environment and interpreter mapping in the IDE.
- Create a `hello.py` and run it from the IDE and terminal.
- Add a `requirements.txt` (when you install first packages).
